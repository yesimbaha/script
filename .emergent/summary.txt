The previous AI engineer successfully initiated a complex browser automation project from scratch, building a bot for www.tankpit.com with a React frontend and FastAPI backend. The development trajectory highlights an iterative problem-solving approach, addressing user requests incrementally and robustly debugging issues. Key challenges included:
1.  **Browser Automation Setup:** Initial difficulties with Playwright installation, pathing, and virtual display (Xvfb) in a containerized environment.
2.  **Game Interface Interaction:** Overcoming dynamic and hidden elements on tankpit.com for login, tank detection, map selection, and game entry.
3.  **Real-time Data Sync:** Ensuring the backend's game state (fuel, position, status) reliably updates the frontend UI via WebSockets.
4.  **Game Logic Implementation:** Translating user-defined bot behaviors (fuel management, equipment collection, defensive actions) into Playwright automation.

The engineer consistently used debugging tools (logs, , screenshots) and the  to identify root causes. Most recently, focus has been on ensuring all bot stats are correctly broadcasted and displayed in the UI, following successful implementation of core game mechanics.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a web-based bot for www.tankpit.com with a UI control panel.
**Bot's Goal:**
*   **Fuel Management:** Prevent fuel from dropping below a specified percentage (25% to refuel, 10% for shields, 85% for safe/stationary).
*   **Screen Arrival Actions:** Upon entering a new screen, immediately press 'S' for radar, then 'D' to lay mines. If needed, move to fuel, then collect all available equipment until full.
*   **Fuel Collection:** When low on fuel, click the cannister with most fuel until over 80%. If all fuels are used and fuel is below 35%, use 'map' command to find and click the most dense fuel area nearby. Once 90%+ fuel, stay stationary.
*   **Experience Farming:** Allow enemies to gain experience by attacking the bot when fuel is high.
*   **Clean Exit:** Press 'Q' to exit the map when the bot is stopped.

**UI Control Panel:**
*   Login section for tankpit.com credentials.
*   Dropdown to select an available tank from the account.
*   Real-time display of fuel percentage and bot status.
*   Adjustable sliders for refuel (default 25%), shield (default 10%), and safe (default 85%) thresholds.
*   Optional target player field.
*   Option to choose desired map type (World, Practice, Tournament).
*   Real-time screen view of the bot's game interface.
*   Start/Stop bot controls.

- ****
    - **Summary**: This is the core of the bot's intelligence. It implements the FastAPI application, handles all API endpoints for bot control, manages Playwright browser automation to interact with www.tankpit.com, performs login, tank detection, map selection, game entry, fuel detection, equipment collection, and broadcasts real-time status updates via WebSockets. It orchestrates all game logic.
    - **Changes Made**:
        - Initial FastAPI setup with  prefix and CORS.
        - Implemented  class for Playwright-based browser automation.
        - , ,  functions for authentication and tank management.
        -  function modified to click Play and then click the center of the map to spawn.
        -  orchestrates game actions (radar 'S', mines 'D', fuel check, equipment collection).
        -  updated multiple times: initially mocked, then visual color analysis (tank color vs black pixels), with text-based fallbacks.
        -  added for 'S' and 'D' key presses, fuel check, and equipment collection.
        -  function enhanced to press 'Q' to exit the map cleanly.
        -  endpoint added, with serialization fixes for Playwright elements.
        -  endpoint added for real-time visual feedback.
        -  updated to include  and intended for  broadcasting.
        - Playwright browser installation, pathing, and Xvfb integration fixes.

- ****
    - **Summary**: This is the main React component for the bot's control panel. It manages the UI state, handles user interactions (login, tank selection, settings update, bot start/stop), displays real-time bot status received via WebSockets, and integrates the live bot screen viewer.
    - **Changes Made**:
        - Initial UI for login, bot status, fuel gauge, and settings sliders.
        - Logic for connecting to WebSocket () for real-time updates.
        - Handlers for login, tank selection, and bot control (start/stop).
        - Added dropdown for map selection in settings.
        - Added display for  in the status panel.
        - Integrated  component to fetch and display real-time screenshots.
        - UI updates to reflect bot status (running, stopped, current action, fuel level).

- ****
    - **Summary**: Provides basic styling for the React frontend components, including layout, colors, and responsive design, specifically for the bot control panel.
    - **Changes Made**:
        - Styles for the main layout, login panel, status panel, fuel gauge, settings, and activity log.
        - Styling adjustments for map selection dropdown and live bot screen.

- ****
    - **Summary**: Lists Python dependencies for the FastAPI backend.
    - **Changes Made**: Added , , , usage: websockets [--version | <uri>], , , .

- ****
    - **Summary**: Manages Node.js dependencies and scripts for the React frontend.
    - **Changes Made**: Ensures , , ,  are present. (Implicitly, yarn install v1.22.22

<pending_tasks>
- **Frontend UI Update for Bot Stats**: The UI is currently not updating , , , and  in real-time despite the backend correctly broadcasting them.
- **Position Detection Implementation**: The  field is stuck at (0,0) and needs proper detection logic to be implemented in the backend and then broadcasted.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a critical bug where the frontend UI was not updating bot statistics in real-time, specifically , , and . The backend API calls (e.g., ) correctly reported the bot's state, but this information was not being reflected in the  UI.

The AI engineer identified that the WebSocket broadcasting mechanism from the backend () was the likely culprit. The initial investigation () revealed that the  function in  was missing the  field in the status dictionary it sent to the frontend. This was subsequently fixed.

Furthermore, the engineer noted that the bot's  was consistently reporting as (0,0). The last action () indicates the engineer was in the process of adding position detection logic to the backend and ensuring its frequent broadcast via WebSockets. The current state is that the  broadcasting has been fixed, and the next step in  is to implement the actual position detection within the bot's cycle and ensure its inclusion in the  payload. The frontend  is set up to receive these updates, but the backend's  needs to push the correct, live  data.
